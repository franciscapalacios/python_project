# Flight Delays Analysis

Welcome to the Flight Delays Visualization project! This Python project aims to study the optimal travel periods and factors to book flights in order to avoid delays. The project focuses on analyzing 2019 flight data and providing insightful visualizations to help users make informed decisions when planning their trips.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

The main components of the project are:

- **data**: The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations?select=raw_data_documentation.txt) and consists of 2019 domesict flights in the US. 
- **notebooks**: In the `python_project.ipynb` notebook you will find the main code used for the exploratory data analysis and visualizations. The `airports_states.ipynb` notebook has the code used to create animated plots on a US map.
- **utils**: The python file `import_clean_data.py` contains utility functions used throughout the project.
